Python Basics


1. Data Types: str, int, float, complex, bytes, bool, sequence types (list, set, tuple, range, dict)
2.  Immutable: we can’t change the value
We have replace() function, but it behaves like temp variable
3. Slicing and dicing 

List are mutable, which means the items can be modified.
But, the type, string, range are immutable and will throw type error.

Few predefined functions

.count(),.find(),.isdigit(),.replace()

1. Shallow copy and deep copy

To find whether something is present or not ( the value in string:)
Instead of find, we can use “in” or “not in” in print function,

str = "abc bcd efd tgh hyh"
print("abc" in str)
print("ttt" not in str)


List:

Append = inserts at the end
insert= it will insert in the specific index
Pop and remove
Clear and delete
Sort and reverse

Tuple:
Same as list, but immutable

Set:
Same as list, but no duplicates allowed, and cannot guarantee in order

Conditional Statements:
 If loop:

Loop:
For, while, do while
